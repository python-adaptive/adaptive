# Tutorial {class}`~adaptive.LearnerND`

```{note}
Because this documentation consists of static html, the `live_plot` and `live_info` widget is not live.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

import adaptive

adaptive.notebook_extension()

import holoviews as hv
import numpy as np


def dynamicmap_to_holomap(dm):
    # XXX: change when https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/3085
    # is fixed.
    vals = {d.name: d.values for d in dm.dimensions() if d.values}
    return hv.HoloMap(dm.select(**vals))
```

Besides 1 and 2 dimensional functions, we can also learn N-D functions: $f: ℝ^N → ℝ^M, N \ge 2, M \ge 1$.

Do keep in mind the speed and [effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) of the learner drops quickly with increasing number of dimensions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def sphere(xyz):
    x, y, z = xyz
    a = 0.4
    return x + z**2 + np.exp(-((x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 0.75**2) ** 2) / a**4)


learner = adaptive.LearnerND(sphere, bounds=[(-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 1)])
runner = adaptive.Runner(learner, loss_goal=1e-3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

await runner.task  # This is not needed in a notebook environment!
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
runner.live_info()
```

Let’s plot 2D slices of the 3D function

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_cut(x, direction, learner=learner):
    cut_mapping = {"XYZ".index(direction): x}
    return learner.plot_slice(cut_mapping, n=100)


dm = hv.DynamicMap(plot_cut, kdims=["val", "direction"])
dm = dm.redim.values(val=np.linspace(-1, 1, 11), direction=list("XYZ"))

# In a notebook one would run `dm` however we want a statically generated
# html, so we use a HoloMap to display it here
dynamicmap_to_holomap(dm)
```

Or we can plot 1D slices

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_cut(x1, x2, directions, learner=learner):
    cut_mapping = {"xyz".index(d): x for d, x in zip(directions, [x1, x2])}
    return learner.plot_slice(cut_mapping)


dm = hv.DynamicMap(plot_cut, kdims=["v1", "v2", "directions"])
dm = dm.redim.values(
    v1=np.linspace(-1, 1, 6), v2=np.linspace(-1, 1, 6), directions=["xy", "xz", "yz"]
)

# In a notebook one would run `dm` however we want a statically generated
# html, so we use a HoloMap to display it here
dynamicmap_to_holomap(dm).opts(hv.opts.Path(framewise=True))
```

The plots show some wobbles while the original function was smooth, this is a result of the fact that the learner chooses points in 3 dimensions and the simplices are not in the same face as we try to interpolate our lines.
However, as always, when you sample more points the graph will become gradually smoother.

## Using any convex shape as domain

Suppose you do not simply want to sample your function on a square (in 2D) or in a cube (in 3D). The LearnerND supports using a `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull` as your domain.
This is best illustrated in the following example.

Suppose you would like to sample you function in a cube split in half diagonally.
You could use the following code as an example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import scipy

def f(xyz):
    x, y, z = xyz
    return x**4 + y**4 + z**4 - (x**2 + y**2 + z**2) ** 2


# set the bound points, you can change this to be any shape
b = [(-1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1), (-1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, -1, -1)]

# you have to convert the points into a scipy.spatial.ConvexHull
hull = scipy.spatial.ConvexHull(b)

learner = adaptive.LearnerND(f, hull)
adaptive.BlockingRunner(learner, npoints_goal=2000)

learner.plot_isosurface(-0.5)
```
