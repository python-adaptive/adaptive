Tutorial Adaptive
=================

`Adaptive <https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive>`__
is a package for adaptively sampling functions with support for parallel
evaluation.

This is an introductory notebook that shows some basic use cases.

We recommend to start with the :ref:`Tutorial `~adaptive.Learner1D``.

.. note::
    Because this documentation consists of static html, the ``live_plot``
    and ``live_info`` widget is not live. Download the notebooks
    in order to see the real behaviour.
