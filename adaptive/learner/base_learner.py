def uses_nth_neighbors(n: int):
    """Decorator to specify how many neighboring intervals the loss function uses.

    Wraps loss functions to indicate that they expect intervals together
    with ``n`` nearest neighbors

    The loss function will then receive the data of the N nearest neighbors
    (``nth_neighbors``) along with the data of the interval itself in a dict.
    The `~adaptive.Learner1D` will also make sure that the loss is updated
    whenever one of the ``nth_neighbors`` changes.

    Examples
    --------

    The next function is a part of the `curvature_loss_function` function.

    >>> @uses_nth_neighbors(1)
    ... def triangle_loss(xs, ys):
    ...    xs = [x for x in xs if x is not None]
    ...    ys = [y for y in ys if y is not None]
    ...
    ...    if len(xs) == 2: # we do not have enough points for a triangle
    ...        return xs[1] - xs[0]
    ...
    ...    N = len(xs) - 2 # number of constructed triangles
    ...    if isinstance(ys[0], Iterable):
    ...        pts = [(x, *y) for x, y in zip(xs, ys)]
    ...        vol = simplex_volume_in_embedding
    ...    else:
    ...        pts = [(x, y) for x, y in zip(xs, ys)]
    ...        vol = volume
    ...    return sum(vol(pts[i:i+3]) for i in range(N)) / N

    Or you may define a loss that favours the (local) minima of a function,
    assuming that you know your function will have a single float as output.

    >>> @uses_nth_neighbors(1)
    ... def local_minima_resolving_loss(xs, ys):
    ...     dx = xs[2] - xs[1] # the width of the interval of interest
    ...
    ...     if not ((ys[0] is not None and ys[0] > ys[1])
    ...         or (ys[3] is not None and ys[3] > ys[2])):
    ...         return loss * 100
    ...
    ...     return loss
