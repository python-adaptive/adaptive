    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        The function to learn. Must take a single real parameter and
        return a real number.
    bounds : pair of reals
        The bounds of the interval on which to learn 'function'.
    loss_per_interval: callable, optional
        A function that returns the loss for a single interval of the domain.
        If not provided, then a default is used, which uses the scaled distance
        in the x-y plane as the loss. See the notes for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : dict
        Sampled points and values.
    pending_points : set
        Points that still have to be evaluated.

    Notes
    -----
    `loss_per_interval` takes 2 parameters: ``xs`` and ``ys``, and returns a
        scalar; the loss over the interval.
    xs : tuple of floats
        The x values of the interval, if `nth_neighbors` is greater than zero it
        also contains the x-values of the neighbors of the interval, in ascending
        order. The interval we want to know the loss of is then the middle
        interval. If no neighbor is available (at the edges of the domain) then
        `None` will take the place of the x-value of the neighbor.
    ys : tuple of function values
        The output values of the function when evaluated at the `xs`. This is
        either a float or a tuple of floats in the case of vector output.


    The `loss_per_interval` function may also have an attribute `nth_neighbors`
    that indicates how many of the neighboring intervals to `interval` are used.
    If `loss_per_interval` doesn't  have such an attribute, it's assumed that is
    uses **no** neighboring intervals. Also see the `uses_nth_neighbors`
    decorator for more information.
