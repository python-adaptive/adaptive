class BaseRunner(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    r"""Base class for runners that use `concurrent.futures.Executor`\'s.

    Parameters
    ----------
    learner : `~adaptive.BaseLearner` instance
    goal : callable, optional
        The end condition for the calculation. This function must take
        the learner as its sole argument, and return True when we should
        stop requesting more points.
    loss_goal : float, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the loss is smaller than this value.
    npoints_goal : int, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the number of points is larger or
        equal than this value.
    end_time_goal : datetime, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the current time is larger or equal than this
        value.
    duration_goal : timedelta or number, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the current time is larger or equal than
        ``start_time + duration_goal``. ``duration_goal`` can be a number
        indicating the number of seconds.
    executor : `concurrent.futures.Executor`, `distributed.Client`,\
               `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`, `ipyparallel.Client` or\
               `loky.get_reusable_executor`, optional
        The executor in which to evaluate the function to be learned.
        If not provided, a new `~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` on
        Linux, and a `loky.get_reusable_executor` on MacOS and Windows.
    ntasks : int, optional
        The number of concurrent function evaluations. Defaults to the number
        of cores available in `executor`.
    log : bool, default: False
        If True, record the method calls made to the learner by this runner.
    shutdown_executor : bool, default: False
        If True, shutdown the executor when the runner has completed. If
        `executor` is not provided then the executor created internally
        by the runner is shut down, regardless of this parameter.
    retries : int, default: 0
        Maximum amount of retries of a certain point ``x`` in
        ``learner.function(x)``. After `retries` is reached for ``x``
        the point is present in ``runner.failed``.
    raise_if_retries_exceeded : bool, default: True
        Raise the error after a point ``x`` failed `retries`.
    allow_running_forever : bool, default: False
        Allow the runner to run forever when the goal is None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    learner : `~adaptive.BaseLearner` instance
        The underlying learner. May be queried for its state.
    log : list or None
        Record of the method calls made to the learner, in the format
        ``(method_name, *args)``.
    to_retry : list of tuples
        List of ``(point, n_fails)``. When a point has failed
        ``runner.retries`` times it is removed but will be present
        in ``runner.tracebacks``.
    tracebacks : list of tuples
        List of of ``(point, tb)`` for points that failed.
    pending_points : list of tuples
        A list of tuples with ``(concurrent.futures.Future, point)``.

    Methods
    -------
    overhead : callable
        The overhead in percent of using Adaptive. Essentially, this is
        ``100 * (1 - total_elapsed_function_time / self.elapsed_time())``.

        This includes the overhead of the executor that is being used.

        the executor also takes about ~5 ms, so you will benefit from using
        Adaptive whenever executing the function takes longer than 100 ms.
        This of course depends on the type of executor and the type of learner

        The end condition for the calculation. This function must take
        the learner as its sole argument, and return True when we should
        stop requesting more points.
        If not provided, the runner will run forever (or stop when no more
        points can be added), or until ``runner.task.cancel()`` is called.
    loss_goal : float, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the loss is smaller than this value.
    npoints_goal : int, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the number of points is larger or
        equal than this value.
    end_time_goal : datetime, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the current time is larger or equal than this
        value.
    duration_goal : timedelta or number, optional
        Convenience argument, use instead of ``goal``. The end condition for the
        calculation. Stop when the current time is larger or equal than
        ``start_time + duration_goal``. ``duration_goal`` can be a number
        indicating the number of seconds.
    executor : `concurrent.futures.Executor`, `distributed.Client`,\
               `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`, `ipyparallel.Client` or\
               `loky.get_reusable_executor`, optional
        The executor in which to evaluate the function to be learned.
        If not provided, a new `~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` on
        Linux, and a `loky.get_reusable_executor` on MacOS and Windows.
    ntasks : int, optional
        The number of concurrent function evaluations. Defaults to the number
        of cores available in `executor`.
    log : bool, default: False
        If True, record the method calls made to the learner by this runner.
    shutdown_executor : bool, default: False
        If True, shutdown the executor when the runner has completed. If
        `executor` is not provided then the executor created internally
        by the runner is shut down, regardless of this parameter.
    ioloop : ``asyncio.AbstractEventLoop``, optional
        The ioloop in which to run the learning algorithm. If not provided,
        the default event loop is used.
    retries : int, default: 0
        Maximum amount of retries of a certain point ``x`` in
        ``learner.function(x)``. After `retries` is reached for ``x``
        the point is present in ``runner.failed``.
    raise_if_retries_exceeded : bool, default: True
        Raise the error after a point ``x`` failed `retries`.
    allow_running_forever : bool, default: True
        If True, the runner will run forever if the goal is not provided.

    Attributes
    ----------
    task : `asyncio.Task`
        The underlying task. May be cancelled in order to stop the runner.
    learner : `~adaptive.BaseLearner` instance
        The underlying learner. May be queried for its state.
    log : list or None
        Record of the method calls made to the learner, in the format
        ``(method_name, *args)``.
    to_retry : list of tuples
        List of ``(point, n_fails)``. When a point has failed
        ``runner.retries`` times it is removed but will be present
        in ``runner.tracebacks``.
    tracebacks : list of tuples
        List of of ``(point, tb)`` for points that failed.
    pending_points : list of tuples
        A list of tuples with ``(concurrent.futures.Future, point)``.

    Methods
    -------
    elapsed_time : callable
        A method that returns the time elapsed since the runner
        was started.
    overhead : callable
        The overhead in percent of using Adaptive. This includes the
        overhead of the executor. Essentially, this is
        ``100 * (1 - total_elapsed_function_time / self.elapsed_time())``.

    Notes
    -----
    This runner can be used when an async function (defined with
    ``async def``) has to be learned. In this case the function will be
    run directly on the event loop (and not in the executor).
