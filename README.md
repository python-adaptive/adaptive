<!-- summary-start -->

Adaptive is an open-source Python library that streamlines adaptive parallel function evaluations.
Rather than calculating all points on a dense grid, it intelligently selects the "best" points in the parameter space based on your provided function and bounds.
With minimal code, you can perform evaluations on a computing cluster, display live plots, and optimize the adaptive sampling algorithm.

Adaptive is most efficient for computations where each function evaluation takes at least ‚âà50ms due to the overhead of selecting potentially interesting points.

To see Adaptive in action, try the [example notebook on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/python-adaptive/adaptive/main?filepath=example-notebook.ipynb) or explore the [tutorial on Read the Docs](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## :rocket: Example usage

Adaptively learning a 1D function and live-plotting the process in a Jupyter notebook:

```python
from adaptive import notebook_extension, Runner, Learner1D

notebook_extension()


def peak(x, a=0.01):
    return x + a**2 / (a**2 + x**2)


learner = Learner1D(peak, bounds=(-1, 1))
runner = Runner(learner, loss_goal=0.01)
runner.live_info()
runner.live_plot()
```

### :floppy_disk: Exporting Data

You can export the learned data as a NumPy array:

```python
data = learner.to_numpy()
```

If you have Pandas installed, you can also export the data as a DataFrame:

```python
df = learner.to_dataframe()
```

## :test_tube: Implemented Algorithms

The core concept in `adaptive` is the *learner*.
A *learner* samples a function at the most interesting locations within its parameter space, allowing for optimal sampling of the function.
As the function is evaluated at more points, the learner improves its understanding of the best locations to sample next.

The definition of the "best locations" depends on your application domain.
While `adaptive` provides sensible default choices, the adaptive sampling process can be fully customized.

The following learners are implemented:

<!-- implemented-algorithms-end -->

- `Learner1D`: for 1D functions `f: ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù^N`,
- `Learner2D`: for 2D functions `f: ‚Ñù^2 ‚Üí ‚Ñù^N`,
- `LearnerND`: for ND functions `f: ‚Ñù^N ‚Üí ‚Ñù^M`,
- `AverageLearner`: for random variables, allowing averaging of results over multiple evaluations,
- `AverageLearner1D`: for stochastic 1D functions, estimating the mean value at each point,
- `IntegratorLearner`: for integrating a 1D function `f: ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù`,
- `BalancingLearner`: for running multiple learners simultaneously and selecting the "best" one as more points are gathered.

Meta-learners (to be used with other learners):

- `BalancingLearner`: for running several learners at once, selecting the "most optimal" one each time you get more points,
- `DataSaver`: for when your function doesn't return just a scalar or a vector.

In addition to learners, `adaptive` offers primitives for parallel sampling across multiple cores or machines, with built-in support for:
[concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html),
[mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.futures.html),
[loky](https://loky.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
[ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and
[distributed](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

<!-- rest-start -->

## :package: Installation

`adaptive` works with Python 3.7 and higher on Linux, Windows, or Mac, and provides optional extensions for working with the Jupyter/IPython Notebook.

The recommended way to install adaptive is using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge adaptive
```

`adaptive` is also available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install "adaptive[notebook]"
```

The `[notebook]` above will also install the optional dependencies for running `adaptive` inside a Jupyter notebook.

To use Adaptive in Jupyterlab, you need to install the following labextensions.

```bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
```

## :wrench: Development

Clone the repository and run `pip install -e ".[notebook,testing,other]"` to add a link to the cloned repo into your Python path:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:python-adaptive/adaptive.git
cd adaptive
pip install -e ".[notebook,testing,other]"
```

We recommend using a Conda environment or a virtualenv for package management during Adaptive development.

To avoid polluting the history with notebook output, set up the git filter by running:

```bash
python ipynb_filter.py
```

in the repository.

To maintain consistent code style, we use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). Install it by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

in the repository.
